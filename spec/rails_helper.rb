# Requires supporting ruby files with custom matchers and macros, etc, in
# spec/support/ and its subdirectories. Files matching `spec/**/*_spec.rb` are
# run as spec files by default. This means that files in spec/support that end
# in _spec.rb will both be required and run as specs, causing the specs to be
# run twice. It is recommended that you do not name files matching this glob to
# end with _spec.rb. You can configure this pattern with the --pattern
# option on the command line or in ~/.rspec, .rspec or `.rspec-local`.
#
# The following line is provided for convenience purposes. It has the downside
# of increasing the boot-up time by auto-requiring all files in the support
# directory. Alternatively, in the individual `*_spec.rb` files, manually
# require only the support files necessary.

# Rails.root.glob('spec/support/**/*.rb').sort_by(&:to_s).each { |f| require f }

# Ensures that the test database schema matches the current schema file.
# If there are pending migrations it will invoke `db:test:prepare` to
# recreate the test database by loading the schema.
# If you are not using ActiveRecord, you can remove these lines.
